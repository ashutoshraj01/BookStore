The software systems they're using have been carefully selected and built from the ground up to work together seamlessly. There are no legacy systems, data, or competing business concerns to manage.    Cut to reality.    You're a Java developer. The marketing guy tells you that \\\"corporate\\\" wants a Flex-based site and you have to deliver it on top of what you already have. Your budget  Don't even ask. \\\"Make it look like the Discovery channel or something.\\\"    Flex on Java assumes you live in the real world   not the demo. This unique book shows you how to refactor an existing web application using the server-side you already know. You'll learn to use Flex 3 in concert with Spring, EJB 3, POJOs, JMS, and other standard technologies. Wherever possible, the examples use free or open source software.    The authors start with a typical Java web app and show you how to add a rich Flex interface. You also learn how to integrate Flex into your server-side Java via the BlazeDS framework, Adobe's open-source remoting and web messaging technology for Flex.    The book shows you how to deploy to not only the web but also to the desktop using the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR). You will learn how to integrate Flex into your existing applications in order to build a next generation application that will delight users.

Griffon, an agile framework that uses Groovy to simplify Swing, makes UI development dramatically faster and easier. In many respects, Griffon is for desktop development what Grails is for web development. While it's based on Swing, its declarative style and approachable level of abstraction is instantly familiar to developers familiar with other technologies such as Flex or JavaFX.

One of the troublesome parts of Swing development is the amount of Java code that is required to get a simple application off the ground.    You'll learn how SwingBuilder (and its cousin builders) present a very palatable alternative in the form of a DSL geared towards building graphical user interfaces. Pair it up with the convention over configuration paradigm, a well tested and tried application source structure (based on Grails) and you have a recipe for quick and effective Swing application development.

The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.    Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.\",\n    status: \"PUBLISH\",\n    authors: [\"Satnam Alag\"],\n    categories: [\"Internet\"]\n  },\n\n  {\n    _id: 8,\n    title: \"Flex on Java\",\n    isbn: \"1933988797\",\n    pageCount: 265,\n    publishedDate: {\n      $date: \"2010-10-15T00:00:00.000-0700\"\n    },\n    thumbnailUrl:\n      \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/allmon.jpg\",\n    shortDescription:\n      \"   A beautifully written book that is a must have for every Java Developer.       Ashish Kulkarni, Technical Director, E-Business Software Solutions Ltd.\",\n    longDescription:\n      \"In the demo, a hip designer, a sharply-dressed marketer, and a smiling, relaxed developer sip lattes and calmly discuss how Flex is going to make customers happy and shorten the workday   all while boosting the bottom line. The software systems they're using have been carefully selected and built from the ground up to work together seamlessly. There are no legacy systems, data, or competing business concerns to manage.    Cut to reality.    You're a Java developer. The marketing guy tells you that \\\"corporate\\\" wants a Flex-based site and you have to deliver it on top of what you already have. Your budget  Don't even ask. \\\"Make it look like the Discovery channel or something.\\\"    Flex on Java assumes you live in the real world   not the demo. This unique book shows you how to refactor an existing web application using the server-side you already know. You'll learn to use Flex 3 in concert with Spring, EJB 3, POJOs, JMS, and other standard technologies. Wherever possible, the examples use free or open source software.    The authors start with a typical Java web app and show you how to add a rich Flex interface. You also learn how to integrate Flex into your server-side Java via the BlazeDS framework, Adobe's open-source remoting and web messaging technology for Flex.    The book shows you how to deploy to not only the web but also to the desktop using the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR). You will learn how to integrate Flex into your existing applications in order to build a next generation application that will delight users.    Flex on Java is approachable for anyone beginning Java and Flex development.    \",\n    status: \"PUBLISH\",\n    authors: [\"Bernerd Allmon\", \"Jeremy Anderson\"],\n    categories: [\"Internet\"]\n  },\n  {\n    _id: 9,\n    title: \"Griffon in Action\",\n    isbn: \"1935182234\",\n    pageCount: 375,\n    publishedDate: {\n      $date: \"2012-06-04T00:00:00.000-0700\"\n    },\n    thumbnailUrl:\n      \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/almiray.jpg\",\n    shortDescription:\n      \"Griffon in Action is a comprehensive tutorial written for Java developers who want a more productive approach to UI development.

Griffon, an agile framework that uses Groovy to simplify Swing, makes UI development dramatically faster and easier. In many respects, Griffon is for desktop development what Grails is for web development. While it's based on Swing, its declarative style and approachable level of abstraction is instantly familiar to developers familiar with other technologies such as Flex or JavaFX.    Griffon in Action is a comprehensive tutorial written for Java developers who want a more productive approach to UI development. In this book, you'll immediately dive into Griffon. After a Griffon orientation and a quick Groovy tutorial, you'll start building examples that explore Griffon's high productivity approach to Swing development. One of the troublesome parts of Swing development is the amount of Java code that is required to get a simple application off the ground.    You'll learn how SwingBuilder (and its cousin builders) present a very palatable alternative in the form of a DSL geared towards building graphical user interfaces. Pair it up with the convention over configuration paradigm, a well tested and tried application source structure (based on Grails) and you have a recipe for quick and effective Swing application development. Griffon in Action covers declarative view development, like the one provided by JavaFX Script, as well as the structure, architecture and life cycle of Java application development\",\n    status: \"PUBLISH\",\n    authors: [\"Andres Almiray\", \"Danno Ferrin\", \"\", \"James Shingler\"],\n    categories: [\"Java\"]\n  }\n];\n\nexport default books;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
